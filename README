The plastex-docbook project contains templates and classes 
to enable the plastex package to render documents written in LaTeX
markup language to DocBook 4.5 and DocBook 5 XML.

To use this package you must install the plasTeX renderer available at
plastex.sourceforge.net

To install plastex-docbook, run setup.py as usual. 

Once installed, invoke plastex as follows:
--renderer=DocBook45 
or 
--renderer=DocBook50
